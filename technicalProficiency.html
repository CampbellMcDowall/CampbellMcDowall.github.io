  <h1>Technical proficiency</h1>

  <p>During this project I feel that I have learnt a lot of new and interesting things, I got the chance to write code in unfamiliar 
  languages and learn about an emerging technology LoRa.</p>


  <h3>What is the overall quality of your code like?</h3>
  </p>For the few programs I have written (for the mDot and Arduino), I tried my best to make the code readable.  
    Unfortunately the Arduino code gets a bit messy due to the requirements of the LoRa configuration.</p>

  <h3>How well did you follow best practices in development?</h3>
  <p>When writing code for the Arduino I tried to ensure the code is easily understandable and commented what wasn’t obvious as stated in the recommended guidelines: 
    As for the mDot code it took me a little bit longer to understand the code but once I did then it used c/c++ best practices where possible alone with following <a href="https://os.mbed.com/users/kellybs1/"> Brendan’s examples</a>.
    While writing Multitech Conduit Documentation I followed the <a href="https://lora.multitech.com/best-practices">MultiTech Best Practices guides</a>.

  <h3>How well did you use appropriate version control?</h3>

  <p>I felt that I used GitHub effectively and wrote commit messages where I thought necessary, though I know that I could have used more descriptive comments and commit messages. 
  When writing code I created repositories for them and when writing documentation.

  <h3>To what extent do you think you contributed an equal portion of the overall project?</h3>
  <p>I think contributed fairly to the project
    By taking on the management role it took a lot of time to organize with stakeholders
    I took on a lot of responsibility to help ensure we were on track to meet deadlines and..................
