	<h1>About me</h1>
	<p>I am completing my degree in the Bachelor of Information Technology with Otago Polytechnic. 
		I have a wide variety of interests and have undertaken many personal projects. 
		The main areas of technology which interest me include; systems administration, project design &amp; implementation and web development. 
		I am a member of The Internet of Things 3rd year project and my role is Project Manager, my key tasks include; organising and monitoring 
		the steps required to ensure we get the network deployed, develop/setup nodes and a gateway and liaising with stakeholders.

	<h1>The project</h1>
	<p>This year the Dunedin IoT (Internet of Things) team aims to research, develop and deploy an open source LoRaWAN network.
		We currently have three gateways consisting of a Multitech Conduit and two consisting of a raspberry pi and mCard, during 
		our research stage we knew that it was benificial to have a few different gateways allowing us to get a better understanding 
		of how they work.
		<br><br>
		Having different types of gateways and nodes allows us to show the community that there are many ways in which 
		they can help or join in for themseleves.  Generally the more expensive options tend to be turn key solutions and cheaper options that 
		can require a little more patience.
		<br><br>
		We plan to cover the majority of Dunedin Central and the Otago Polytechnic/Otago University Campus, this initial roll out will allow 
		for the most people to get a chance to use the LoRaWAN network.  In future years the plan is to expand the network and allow users to
		create there own applications for displaying node data.

	<h2>My role in the team</h2>
	<p>I worked on many different parts of this project including but not limited to:</p>	    
	<ul>
		<li>Managing parts of the project, keeping us on track and following up on issues/requests etc.</li>
    		<li>Myself and the engineering department modified enclosures for the two raspberry pi and mCard gateways</li>
    		<li>Developing various nodes for gateway range coverage and an example temperature/humidity and soil moisture node along with others for smaller sensing jobs such as light levels</li>
    		<li>Configured the Multitech Conduit from the factory and reconfigured it when it was installed at Otago Polytechnic</li>
		<li>Contact for many stakeholders.  This included managing installations, parts ordering and moving our LoRa server to Amazon Web Services etc.</li>
