	<h1>Hello I am Campbell McDowall!</h1>
	<p>This year the Dunedin IoT (Internet of Things) team aims to research, develop and deploy an open source LoRaWAN network.
		We currently have three gateways consisting of a Multitech Conduit and two consisting of a raspberry pi and mCard, during 
		our research stage we knew that it was benificial to have a few different gateways allowing us to get a better understanding 
		of how they work.
		<br><br>
		Having different types of gateways and nodes allows us to show the community that there are many ways in which 
		they can help or join in for themseleves.  Generally the more expensive options tend to be turn key solutions and cheaper options that 
		can require a little more patience.
		<br><br>
		We plan to cover the majority of Dunedin Central and the Otago Polytechnic/Otago University Campus, this initial roll out will allow 
		for the most people to get a chance to use the LoRaWAN network.  In future years the plan is to expand the network and allow users to
		create there own applications for displaying node data.
