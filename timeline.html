				Obtained suitable enclosures, these enclosures I found while helping to clean out a store room.   They are old unused outdoor wireless access points that actually already have mounting hardware for mounting them on a pole.
				<br>I also started a list of parts that are necessary to get these gateways deployed, all group members could submit parts or devices that they would like or that we need then I collated them into a list which I took to Rob which we had to modify to fit within budget but still meet our needs.
				<br>While organising this list we also needed to look for suitable antennas, myself and Brendan decided that the solutions offered by Elecomes would suit our applications best.

I believe this should be sufficient but it can be changed at a later date.
