			<td>Unfortunately the first lot of firmware and instructions were not suitable for changing the mDot Box firmware.
				The process was a bit confusing due to their being so many firmware versions available and they needed to be installed in a specific order and the mDot needed to use a specific version before I could change the frequency. 
				Changing the firmware and frequencies seemed to have worked, although there is sometimes an error in the serial command.  I believe it wasnâ€™t a necessary bug to be fixed as it was to do with their firmware. /td>

This included getting permission to install a gateway on the roof of H block and discussion around node ideas to make the technology useful.  We are required to fill in a development to production form which can be handed to contractors so they understand what they are doing.

				Obtained suitable enclosures, these enclosures I found while helping to clean out a store room.   They are old unused outdoor wireless access points that actually already have mounting hardware for mounting them on a pole.

				I also started a list of parts that are necessary to get these gateways deployed, all group members could submit parts or devices that they would like or that we need then I collated them into a list which I took to Rob which we had to modify to fit within budget but still meet our needs.

				While organising this list we also needed to look for suitable antennas, myself and Brendan decided that the solutions offered by Elecomes would suit our applications best.
				(Looking for a suitable antenna, helpful information:  http://www.tp-link.com/us/FAQ-3.html).</td>

This involved removing all of the screws, bolts and Wi-Fi components so I was left with a shell and the cooling unit.  I am planning on being able to use the Peltier as the m-cards can get quite hot, which I suspect will only get worse once the enclosure has no airflow as it needs to be waterproof.

			<td>Before the gateway enclosures were built it was determined that the Multitech Conduit would actually be situated inside so students could access it if required.  This changed the requirements for the gateway enclosures as we only needed 2 which were nearly the same.  We may need a wall mounting plate for the Conduit at a later date.

				I had to figure out how the gateway cooling was going to work, for this I borrowed a lab power supply and tested how the Peltier unit (For more information on how these work: http://www.marlow.com/resources/general-faq/6-how-do-thermoelectric-coolers-tecs-work.html) responded to 5v power and limiting the current.  I believe this should be sufficient but it can be changed at a later date.  I am currently looking for a source for silica packets so that there will be little to no moisture that can condensate on the electronics.

				I also requested that a hole be added to the gateway enclosures so we can add temperature monitoring to the gateways.</td>
