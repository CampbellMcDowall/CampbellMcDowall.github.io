<h1>Professional proficiency</h1>

<p>During this project I feel that I have shown I am professional proficient by; writing formal emails 
  to stakeholders, attending meetings, meeting deadlines and doing my fair share of the work load.
</p>


<h3>How often do you attend scheduled group meetings/scrums?</h3>
<p>I attended all meeting if it was possible, if I couldn’t physically make it to a meeting or could be late then I 
  would message Tom our project staff supervisor and get an update as soon as possible when I returned.</p>

<h3>How well did you communicate with others in your group or subgroup?</h3>
<p>I was nearly always contactable via slack, email or by person.
  At times it was hard to contact stakeholders if I didn’t have enough information to respond, 
  I could have improved this by responding saying I am gathering information to assist etc.

<h3>How well did you document your work throughout the project?</h3>
<p>As I went I wrote documentation trying my best to make it as clear as possible to allow people who have never used 
  the product/technology a step by step guide as it can be complicated to get certain parts working correctly.  
  Including lots of screenshots and images should help reinforce the text content.</p>

<h3>How well did you respond to problems or changing requirements?</h3>
<p>Due to the nature of this project the scope, plan and what technologies we were going to used changed constantly.  
  I felt like I adapted well to this an example being deciding to stay with the LoRa server instead of migrating to a 
  TTN (The Things Network) server.  There were many times where plans had to modified to meet deadlines and targets but 
  in the end, I am happy with the results and we accomplished the goal that we had set out to complete.</p>
