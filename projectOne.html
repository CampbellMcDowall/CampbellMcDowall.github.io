			<h1>Project One</h1>
			<p>For this Project I was on the Internet of Things team, we were tasked to create a LoRaWAN network that was to be made freely available for public use.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="plan">
			<br>
			<h2>The plan</h2>
			<p>
				This semister we were aiming to have a working LoRaWAN network in Dunedin, New Zealand.
				Meaning at least one gateway that connects to a backend server such as the Internet Of Things or Lora server.		
				
				<br><br>
				At first we were looking at getting up to 5 gateways; three of which would cover parts of dunedin, one would be for a future deployment and the last would be for in house development.
				We soon realised that it was not going to be cheap to implement a solution that would work and cover the range we required.  We looked at the previous teams work and decided that we would
				need to start from scratch due to the many problems they were having with hardware incompatibilitys etc.
				<br><br>

			<h2>My Contributions</h2>
			<p>
				For the first few weeks The team worked together to look through the previous teams work and see if we could salvage any of it,
				we soon decided that it was going to save more time if we re-evaluated the whole project and started from the beginning.
				We spent a solid amount of time researching new gateways that had became available and also solutions that also where not available
				options for the previous team.
				<br><br>
				I assisted in contacting various companies for information and prices of their gateways, finding a suitable gateway at a reasonable price was 
				difficult but many companies where interested in our project.  The main problem we had with choosing a gateway was finding one that we could use legally in New Zealand,
				after research and talking to some interested parties we knew we had to be ideally between 915 and 925mhz.<br> 
				Finding a gateway that allowed for these frequencies was difficult
			</p>
			<br><br>
			<p>
				From my research I definitely knew that it was going to be difficult to get one of the gateways and nodes working if we went with a cheap or Do it yourself option.  
				If the budget would have allowed it would have been ideal to use a solution by Kerlink or Libelium as these companies offer proper support and proven working systems.
				Implementation of the gateways would potentially involve waterproofing, lightning protection, installation of the gateway on top of a building or other high structure.  
				For the installation it was likely that a professional would have to install it and permission would need to be granted.
				<br><br>
				The first gateway we purchased from Haxiot and unfortunatly it did not meet our expectations or as expected, code that was provided did not work properly and required the team to look
				at and reconfigure the code to run.  It was not a good start tothe project and dampened spirits slightly.  Now we have a Multitech Conduit which I think is a good solution by Multitech 
				that will work great for our situation, it wasnt the most expensive option which will allow us to get more gateways 
				when required.  The gateway has a setting for New Zealand frequencies, it is more of an industrial solution than the Haxiot gateway and Multitech offer great support.

				<h2>Tasks</h2>
				<br>
				<h3>Room sensor</h3>
				<p>
					Brendan and myself were given a task to make a room sensor which we would build based off a schematic given to us, we researched the parts and purchased them or best alternative.  
					As the project specification changed we had to adapt the sensor and project.  Sensors used in the most current version include temperature, humidity, light (lux), sound and motion.  
					The data is collected at intervals then stored in a csv file on the micro sd card.  
					We divided up the sensors then set off to build smaller example circuits for each or we used the available online documentation.  
					<br>My main task was to join the various sensors together into one project (the final version).  Originally we used an Arduino Uno which I quickly realised was not going to be big enough. 
					The arduino Uno ran out of memory very quickly after we added the micro sd card breakout board and lux sensor.  Though we tried to make the project take less space and after half a week we swapped the Uno’s for Mega’s.  
					With more memory there was no issue writing to the micro SD card file.<br><br>
					Creating the room sensor generally went quite well with the main issues coming from running out of ram and flash memory on the Uno,
					combining the

				<h3>Use case essay</h3>
				<p>
					One of our tasks was to choose a LoRaWAN use case and produce an essay about the subject.
					I chose Amsterdam and their use of The Things Network LoRaWAN, focusing on current uses and also concerns involved with the technology.
					Amsterdam is where <a href="https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/">The Things Network</a> started and is mostly developed from, they also currently have some interesting and unique use cases.
					While researching for this essay it was not very easy to find reliable information on the LoRaWAN networks, many articles and eduational journals are copyied and tweaked versions of eachother.
					This ment there are a lot of lnks but not with a lot of useful information.  Due to the LoRaWAN protocol being relatively young it is always changing and evolving with how people use it, teh standard is
					not fully defined so it has allowed some manufacturers to put their own take on how it should be best implemented.  This is good for innovation but can be difficult when you want solid information about setting up the best possible network.

				<h3>Things Network Server - Research and Install</h3>
				<p>

					The process of installing The Things Network server was not easy.  The code was being regularly updated, there where a lot of dependencies required that each have their own
					install guides, 
					This is the <a href="https://github.com/OtagoPolytechnic/ThingsNetworkDunedin/tree/gh-pages/development/servers/TTNserver/README.md">basic TTN install guide</a>
					<br>
					By following this guide I got most of the server configured and installed on a dedicated server.  While installing the server it seemed as every dependency failed to install how they explained it and required me to search
					forums to get the information required.  An example being installing RabbitMQ, there is no explaination apart from "Make sure you have Redis and RabbitMQ installed and running.  On a fresh installation you might need to install the MQTT plugin for RabbitMQ."
					You then follow their documentation on how to install it <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/install-windows.html">on rabbitmq.com</a><br>
					The TTN guide hen explains you need to use the <a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/management.html">management plugin.</a><br><br>
					I found ensuring your development environment was setup correctly was the hardest part of installing the server due to how many different variables you needed to configure correctly with no documentation on what was required.
						
					<br>It was not the best way to install The Things Network server.  After the first attempt of installing the server didn't completely work we decided to do it as a team,
					this way we had more people looking at how to install each part

				<h3>Documentation</h3>

				</p>
				<h3>Other tasks</h3>
				<p>
					After the team having mixed results with the Haxiot gateway, I decided to do some further research an to reach out to Haxiot.
					From this I learnt the following "The Gateway to the NS uses SSL to connect. You will need port 443/TCP open from your virtual Gateway to the Network Server. 
					You will need to use the IP address for either us1.loriot.io or au1.loriot.io, depending on the server you have setup on your system."
					After checking with the Technician Rob I found that this shouldn’t be any problem as the ports are open. 
					I then proceeded to exactly follow the haxiot instructions and also try a few different virtual machine that they offered,
					After suspecting that something on the Polytech network was blocking the gateway from connecting to the Loriot service I was testing with.
					I attempted to use a VPN to another country, this allowed me to bypass any restrictions the gateway have been facing, the gateway finally connected 
					but was too slow to be used due to the connection being very slow.  
					<br>
					Oscar and myself started to set up the Multitech Conduit when it arrived, we connected directly to the gateway to confgure it for New Zealand frequencies,
					Because unfortunatly it seems as something on the polytech network was blocking the gateway from connecting over the local network.
					As the new semester starts we will get this gateway to connect to the server over the network and get data from the server using a mosquitto subscription.
					We plan to build a few example nodes and have guides/tutorials available for community users to easily follow to make their own nodes.
