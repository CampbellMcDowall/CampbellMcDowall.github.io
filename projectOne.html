			<h1>Project One</h1>
			<p>For this Project I was on the Internet of Things team, </p>

			<h2>The plan</h2>
			<p>
				This semister we were aiming to have a working LoRaWAN network in Dunedin, New Zealand.
				Meaning at least one gateway that connects to a backend server such as the Internet Of Things or Lora server.
				
				
				
				<br><br>
				At first we were looking at getting up to 5 gateways; three of which would cover parts of dunedin, one would be for a future deployment and the last would be for in house development.
				We soon realised that it was not going to be cheap to implement a solution that would work and cover the range we required.  We looked at the previous teams work and decided that we would
				need to start from scratch due to the many problems they were having with hardware incompatibilitys etc.

			<h2>My Contributions</h2>
			<p>
				For the first few weeks The team worked together to look through the previous teams work and see if we could salvage any of it,
				we soon decided that it was going to save more time if we re-evaluated the whole project and started from the beginning.
				We spent a solid amount of time researching new gateways that had became available and also solutions that also where not available
				options for the previous team.
